As of IFL Boot Disk version LBD214EN, the NET_DEVICE_NAMES option is now
configured from the Network Interface Settings menu item while running one
of the Linux make scripts (makeISO, makeHDD, or makePXE) to create a custom
version. 

The feature is called Persistent Naming on the menu. The Help item available
from the menu screen explains the feature, as well as how to configure it.
