Using a wireless network adapter with the Image for Linux Network Boot Disk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For wireless network adapter support, the IFL Boot Disk includes:
 - all native drivers included in the Linux kernel
 - the wireless-tools package (iwconfig etc.)
 - the wpa_supplicant package to support WPA/WPA2 encryption.  
 - the ndiswrapper module and utilities that make it possible to use a 
   Windows driver in Linux for many wireless network adapters. 

As of IFL Boot Disk version LBD214EN, all network interface configuration
is done from either the Network Configuration item on the running disk, or
can be pre-configured from the Linux make scripts (makeISO, makeHDD, and
makePXE) by selecting the Network Interface Settings menu item while creating
a custom version from Linux. This includes both wired and wireless interfaces,
as well as configuring ndiswrapper and the persistent naming feature.

For this reason, all network configuration items have been removed from the
config.txt file. In addition, it is no longer necessary to create network
profiles, or manually edit wpa_supplicant.conf for wireless interfaces. 

Please refer to the Help items available from the network interface menu 
screens for additional information.
