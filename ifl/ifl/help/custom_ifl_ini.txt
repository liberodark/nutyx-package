The following is a description of how to include a customized ifl.ini file
when creating IFL boot media with the makeISO/HDD/PXE scripts from Linux.

1. Run the setup script (again if necessary) and accept the option to extract
   config.zip. Doing this will populate the IFL directory with several files
   and directories needed to customize IFL boot media.

2. One of the files extracted in step 1 will be ifl-custom.ini, which will
   initially be empty. It is named ifl-custom.ini to avoid conflict with
   ifl.ini, which contains IFL settings for running IFL from the Linux
   distribution.

3. Edit ifl-custom.ini to include any ifl.ini settings you would like to
   include on the boot media.

4. Run makeISO, makeHDD, or makePXE to create the IFL boot media. These 
   scripts will copy ifl-custom.ini to the boot media as ifl.ini, and the 
   file will appear in the /tbu directory on boot. The makeHDD and makePXE
   scripts must be run with the /c option (custom version) in order to
   include ifl-custom.ini on the boot media.

5. If you have no need for any IFL settings on the custom boot media, the file
   can just be left empty. It won't have any effect. 

6. See readme.txt for additional information on how to customize the IFL boot
   disk.
