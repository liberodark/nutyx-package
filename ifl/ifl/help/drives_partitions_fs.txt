This file is to provide information relevant to working with drives,
partitions, and file systems on the IFL Boot Disk. The file is divided 
into the following topics:

1. Working with drives and partitions (refers to KB article 382)
2. Summary of supported file systems and available utilities
3. Partitioning utilities


1. Working with drives and partitions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Information pertaining to naming, mounting, and unmounting drives and 
partitions can now be found in TeraByte KB article 382, which is located
at the following link:

http://www.terabyteunlimited.com/kb/article.php?id=382

Note that both the console and GUI versions of the IFL Boot Disk now
contain the 'dpmount' script, which can be used to interactively mount
and unmount drives and partitions. To use 'dpmount' on the console
version, exit to the command prompt and type 'dpmount'. To use it on
the GUI boot disk, select the "mnt" icon, or select "Mount Drive or
Partition" from the right-click menu.

Also note that mounting a drive or partition is not required for the
vast majority of imaging operations. IFL is able to access all common 
partition types (NTFS, Ext2/3/4, FAT16, FAT32) internally to the program,
which makes mounting them unecessary.


2. Summary of supported file systems and available utilities:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FAT file systems (FAT12/16/32)
 - mount and access
 - format (mkdosfs)
 - check (dosfsck)

NTFS
 - mount and access (ntfs-3g)
 - format (mkntfs)
 - resize (ntfsresize, file system only)
 - set volume label (ntfslabel)

Linux ext2/ext3/ext4
 - mount and access
 - format (mke2fs)
 - check (e2fsck)
 - resize (resize2fs, file system only))
 - view superblock data (tune2fs)
 - set volume label (e2label)

Linux reiserfs (not reiser4) 
 - mount and access
 - format (mkreiserfs)
 - check (reiserfsck)
 - resize (resize_resiserfs, file system only)
 - view superblock data (debugreiserfs)

XFS
 - mount and access
 - format (mkfs.xfs)

UFS
 - mount and access

JFS
 - mount and access

Most of the utilities listed above will give the command line syntax and
options by typing the command without any parameters. For more complete
information, please refer to the Linux man page for each command.

Please note that the resizing utilites listed above will ONLY resize the 
file system and NOT the partition itself. This means that resizing will 
be a two step operation; one for resizing the file system, and another to
resize the partition. If you are not already familiar with these utilities,
it is highly recommended that you first study their man pages, and 
experiment on a non-critical drive/partition.


3. Partitioning utilities:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are 2 partitioning utilities available on the IFL boot disk:

fdisk - this is the most commonly used Linux partitioning utility. It has 
two basic modes of operation; command line and interactive. From the command
line, it is primarily used to list partitions on a drive (or on all drives 
at once) as follows: 

fdisk -l             list all partitions on all drives
fdisk -l /dev/hdb    list all partitions on /dev/hdb
fdisk -l /dev/sda    list all partitions on /dev/sda

To use fdisk interactively, just type a command such as 'fdisk /dev/hda' to
work with hard drive /dev/hda. Then, typing 'm' within fdisk will display
the menu of options available. An important thing to know when using fdisk
interactively is that nothing actually gets written to the disk until you 
use the 'w' (write) command from the menu. Until then, all changes you make 
are only in RAM, and you can exit with 'q' (quit) to cancel any changes you
have made during the session.

sfdisk - is strictly a command line program, recommended only for advanced
users.

For more information on these utilities, please refer to their Linux man
pages.
