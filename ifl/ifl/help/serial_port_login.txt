The IFL Network Disk can be configured to enable login from a serial port
connection. To do this, a custom disk must be created using the following 
steps:

- edit config.txt to uncomment 1 of the 3 lines under the SERIAL_PORTS option.
  
- the choices are COM1 only, COM2 only, or both.

- create the custom disk by running the makeISO, makeHDD, or makePXE script.
  
- for makeHDD and makePXE, the /c option must be used to create a custom
  version.

After booting from the custom disk, you will be able to log in at the enabled
serial port(s) by using a terminal program set up as a VT100 terminal, and
configured at 9600 8-N-1. These are typically the default settings for most
terminal programs, such as HyperTerminal from Windows, or GtkTerm from Linux. 

The login will be as root, with a default password of "ifl". If desired, the
default password can be changed while running one of the 3 make scripts
mentioned above. 

Note that while the IFL screens will be visable, they will be difficult to use
due to the limitations of the serial port interface. For this reason, the 
serial ports may be best suited for command line operation using the IFL 
console mode.

The IFL Network Disk can also be logged into remotely via an SSH session over
a network connection. If possible, this would be the preferred method of
remote access, since 100% functionality of the IFL program will be available.
Please see the file network.txt for more information on SSH.
